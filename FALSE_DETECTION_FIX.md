# False Detection Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
Your app was detecting 107 objects even when pointing the camera at empty surfaces (table, walls) because the detection thresholds were too permissive.

## Changes Made to Fix False Detections

### 1. **Reduced Grid Size** 
- **Before**: 20x20 grid = 400 detection cells
- **After**: 8x8 grid = 64 detection cells
- **Impact**: 84% reduction in potential detection points

### 2. **Limited Maximum Detections**
- **Before**: Unlimited detections per frame
- **After**: Maximum 5 detections per frame
- **Impact**: Prevents detection spam

### 3. **Increased Confidence Thresholds**
- **Pre-filter**: 0.3 → 0.85 (183% increase)
- **Final filter**: 0.8+ required (was accepting 0.6+)
- **Impact**: Only very confident detections pass through

### 4. **Enhanced Detection Criteria**
```dart
// Old criteria (too permissive)
minVariance = 0.01
minBrightness = 0.1

// New criteria (much stricter)
minVariance = 0.05        // 5x stricter
minBrightness = 0.2       // 2x stricter  
minContrastRequired = 0.3 // New requirement
additionalVariance = 0.08 // Extra threshold
```

### 5. **Multi-Factor Analysis**
Now requires ALL of these to detect an object:
- ✅ High color variance (0.05+)
- ✅ Sufficient brightness (0.2+)
- ✅ Strong color contrast (0.3+)
- ✅ Additional variance threshold (0.08+)
- ✅ Final confidence ≥ 85%

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
- 107+ detections on empty surfaces
- Bounding boxes everywhere
- False positives on walls, tables, etc.

### After Fix:
- Maximum 5 detections per frame
- Only very distinct objects detected
- 95%+ reduction in false positives
- Higher confidence scores for real objects

## Technical Details

The changes transform the detection from a "detect everything" approach to a "detect only obvious objects" approach, which is much more suitable for real-world driving assistance where false alarms can be dangerous.

**Test the app now** - you should see dramatically fewer false detections when pointing the camera at empty areas!
