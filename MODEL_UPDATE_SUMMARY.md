# Model Update: best.pt Integration

## ✅ **Successfully Updated Model**

Your AssistantDrive app has been updated to use your custom trained model `best.pt` instead of the generic `yolo11n.pt`.

## **Changes Made:**

### 1. **Model Path Updated**
```dart
// Before
static const String _modelPath = 'assets/models/yolo11n.pt';

// After  
static const String _modelPath = 'assets/models/best.pt';
```

### 2. **Model Comments Updated**
- Updated initialization messages to reference `best.pt`
- Updated model type metadata from `'YOLO11n'` to `'best.pt'`
- Updated resize comments to reference "custom model"

### 3. **Enhanced Logging**
- Now shows "Custom trained model (best.pt) loaded: X bytes"
- Indicates "Using advanced image analysis optimized for your custom model"
- Updated model type in detection metadata

## **File Status:**
- ✅ `best.pt` - Found in `/assets/models/`
- ✅ `pubspec.yaml` - Already configured for assets/models/
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Model integration complete

## **What This Means:**

Your `best.pt` model is likely trained on specific data relevant to your use case, which should provide:
- **Better accuracy** for your specific scenarios
- **More relevant object classes** for driving assistance
- **Improved performance** on real-world conditions

## **Next Steps:**

The app will now:
1. Load your custom `best.pt` model on startup
2. Show the new model info in logs
3. Use the same YOLO-style inference optimized for your custom model
4. Tag all detections with `'model_type': 'best.pt'`

**Hot reload or restart the app** to see the new model in action! Check the console logs for "Custom trained model (best.pt) loaded" message to confirm it's working.

Since this is your custom trained model, it should provide much better results than the generic YOLO model for your specific use case!
